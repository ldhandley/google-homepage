# google-homepage

**Goal**
Re-create the Google homepage using HTML & CSS.

**Reflection**
I was already pretty comfortable with HTML from previous software work, but this project was good practice in CSS, which I have less experience writing. Specifically, I got practice in CSS Grid. I have done many previous projects using Bootstrap, which I think makes grid work easier, but CSS Grid seems like a more multi-purpose, open-ended tool that may come in handy in the future.
